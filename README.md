## 🖥️ About the Project

This application derives from a legacy project, where I seek to improve it by applying microservices techniques allowing the new application to perform independent scaling of APIs, grouped according to the client's business domains. as a way to show my knowledge.! 🚀

## ⚙️ Architecture
The software design pattern is defined by an adaptation of MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture concepts. As this is a strictly back-end development, the view module will not be considered during this phase. Figure 2 represents the project architecture.

</h1>

To design this project we chose the MVC architecture, using DTO on the layers. The reason for this choice is that with mvc architecture we have the following benefits:
- System maintenance becomes easier;
- Reuse of code, mainly from the model layer, which can be reused in other projects;
- Easy for multiple developers to collaborate and work together;
- Easier to debug as we have multiple levels correctly written in the app;
